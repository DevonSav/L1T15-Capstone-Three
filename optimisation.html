            <h3>Chunks</h3>
            <p>Constantly rendering the entire world is ineffecient and also basically impossible(especially using traditional rendering).
                By breaking the world up into <i>Chunks</i> however we can load only the parts we need.
                While the world may exist far beyond these boundaries we only ever render a small portion nearest to the player.
            </p>
            <p>Most voxel engines load only the chunks in a small radius around the player at any given time.
                The most popular example of this would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft">Minecraft</a>.
                The size of these chunks can vary depending on use case but Minecraft has grouped its blocks into <b>16x256x16</b> columns(up until version 1.17).
                One downside of this is that the world extends <i>vertically</i> only as high and low as the columns dimensions.
            </p>

                <p>An area of loaded chunks in Minecraft with different chunk loading distances. All in the same section of the world.</p>
            </div>
            <p>As you can see the chunks are loaded in a square formation around the centerpoint(the player).
                Notice the sharp cutoff at the edges of the world; this is where the loaded chunks end.
                Usually these shap edges will be hidden with some kind of fog. For the sake of this example I have disabled this.
            </p>
            <p>More chunks loaded means a greater portion of the world is actually shown and thus the player can see farther.
                How many chunks are shown can be easily increased at any time but of course comes at a sizeable performance cost.
            </p>
            <p>While Minecraft uses only horizontal columns, many voxel engines can also be set to use chunks which stack vertically as well; allowing for greater player exploration on the vertical axis.</p>

            <h3 id="optimisation1">Greedy meshing</h3>
            <p>While disabling hidden faces is a good start there are still more ways to gain extra performance.
                Before we were rendering every face for each cube individually. <i>Greedy meshing</i> is one method we can use to improve this.
            </p>

            <div class="img-with-desc">
                <img class="content-img" src ="images/2blocks_grass.png" alt="2_grass_blocks" style="margin-bottom: 2px;">
                <img class="content-img" src ="images/2blocks_grass_greedy.png" alt="2_grass_blocks_greedy" style="margin-top: 0;">
                <p>Two blocks next to each other before and after greedy meshing. Notice how the textures in the second image are repeated accordingly.</p>
            </div>

            <p>As you can see above, greedy meshing essentially groups similar faces together to reduce the number of triangles.
                It is important to note that using this method means you have to scale the face textures properly or else it may look stretched or warped.
                This is also why most greedy meshing is done only in long lines of block faces or square groups of block faces.
            </p>
            <p>In an actual environment it may look something like below.</p>

                <p>Please note that as I have yet to implement greedy meshing in my own engine these images are not mine.</p>

            </div>
            <p>As you can tell this method is most effective for reducing triangle counts in flat areas. Making it ideal for large lakes and areas of open ground.</p>

            <h3 id="optimisation2">LOD systems</h3>
            <p>A common technique for improving performance in large games is to reduce the detail of distant objects.
                As far away objects are usually smaller on-screen they have no real reason to show details that can't actually be seen by the player.
                A LOD or <i>Level of Detail</i> system uses this to its advantage by swapping out the models of distant objects with lower quality ones which have fewer triangles and often lower resolution textures.
            </p>
            <div class="img-with-desc">
                <img class="content-img" src ="https://www.pluralsight.com/content/dam/pluralsight/blog/dt/wp-uploads/2014/03/LOD1.jpg" alt="LOD_example">
                <p>Example of different LODs for a barrel in a video game. (<a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/film-games/whats-the-difference-a-comparison-of-modeling-for-games-and-modeling-for-movies">source</a>)</p>
                <p>The lowest level LOD sharp edges may look bad up close but it works quite well when viewed from far away.</p>
            </div>
            <p>With a well-executed LOD system the player won't be able to tell the difference between close and far models.</p>
            <p>Using this logic we could try something similar for our voxel engine.
                This is a complex topic and as I have yet to tackle this myself there is no writeup yet.
            </p>
            <p>Until then it may be worthwhile to read up about the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree">octrees</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_voxel_octree">sparse voxel octrees</a>.</p>
