            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>This site assumes you are familiar with the concept of a game-engine and how computers render 3D graphics.
                This will guide you through only the most basic theory of cubic voxel engines and how they are used to render vast scenes without a massive performance penalty.
                Specifically this will focus on large blocky voxels like those seen in the popular videogame <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft">Minecraft</a>.
                This will not cover world terrain generation.

            <p>Voxel engines come in many forms, can function is vastly different ways and can be used for many purposes.
                In the next section we will go through just one method in which a developer could choose render voxels in their engine.
            </p>
            <h3>What is a voxel?</h3>
            <p>Well according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
            <q>In 3D computer graphics, a voxel represents a value on a regular grid in three-dimensional space.</q>
            <br>
            <p>But what does this mean? Well imagine a pixel on a screen. This is a cubic unit set on a 2D grid made of many other equally sized units.
                Now if those pixels had depth / volume they could be called a volumetric-pixel or a <i>'voxel'</i>. There is much more to voxels than just this.
                For our purposes however we will think of voxels as cubes in a 3D grid. They will represent the smallest unit in our engine.
                Throughout this site I may use the terms 'voxel', 'block' or 'cube'. These are all interchangeable terms and mean roughly the same thing in this context.
